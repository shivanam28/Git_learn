ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your email" - generate ssh key 
eval $$(ssh-agent -s) - return agent pid
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa - add identity 
tail ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub - return ssh key cpoy it

now the copied ssh key paste it in new SSH key field and after that your ssh key is added!..




To make shortcut of commands use 

git config --global alias.st status - everytime you write st. It takes it as status.
git config --global alias.unstage 'restore --stagged--' - this unstage word will now take it as to restore stagged files.
git config --global alias.last 'log -p -1' - To watch last commit
